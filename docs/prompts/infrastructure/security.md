   - Account lockouts and unlocks

5. **Audit Log Viewer**:
   - Create audit log page in admin dashboard
   - Filtering by user, action, date range, app
   - Export audit logs to CSV/JSON
   - Real-time audit log streaming

6. **Security Event Detection**:
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Admin actions outside business hours
   - Bulk data modifications
   - Unusual IP address patterns
   - Privilege escalation attempts

7. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain audit logs for 1 year
