# Multi-Team Micro-App Development Strategy

**Status**: PENDING DECISION - On hold for strategic review  
**Created**: 06-Jul-2025 (Sunday, 00:45 IST)  
**Decision Required By**: TBD  
**Impact**: High - Affects entire platform scaling strategy

## 🎯 Current Situation

### **TalentExcel Micro-App Teams**

- **Team A**: Internship micro-app development
- **Team B**: Fellowship micro-app development
- **Similarity**: Both micro-apps are quite similar with mainly UX differences
- **Question**: Should same team develop both or separate teams?

### **Broader Context: 20-App Ecosystem**

- **Vision**: 20+ large apps with individual domains
- **Structure**: Each app will have multiple micro-apps (sub-domains or /app-name)
- **Example**: talentexcel.com/internships, talentexcel.com/fellowships
- **Scale**: Potentially 100+ micro-apps across the platform

---

## 🤔 Key Decision Points

### **Primary Question**

Should we use:

1. **Single team** to develop both Internship and Fellowship micro-apps?
2. **Separate teams** for each micro-app?

### **Secondary Questions**

1. **Repository Access**: Should teams see each other's code?
2. **Code Sharing**: How much should be shared vs. isolated?
3. **Information Sharing**: What TalentExcel context should teams receive?
4. **Scaling Strategy**: How will this approach work for 20+ apps?

## 🔍 Analysis Framework

### **Option 1: Single Team Approach**

#### **Pros:**

- **Consistency**: Unified UX/UI approach across micro-apps
- **Efficiency**: Shared knowledge and faster cross-pollination
- **Resource Management**: Easier to allocate team members
- **Quality Control**: Single code review and testing process
- **Cost Effective**: Lower coordination overhead

#### **Cons:**

- **Slower Delivery**: Sequential development of micro-apps
- **Limited Specialization**: Less domain expertise per micro-app
- **Bottleneck Risk**: Single team becomes critical path
- **Context Switching**: Team must understand multiple domains

### **Option 2: Separate Teams Approach**

#### **Pros:**

- **Parallel Development**: Faster delivery with simultaneous work
- **Specialization**: Teams become domain experts
- **Scalability**: Model works for 20+ apps
- **Innovation**: Different approaches can be A/B tested
- **Independence**: Teams can work at their own pace

#### **Cons:**

- **Coordination Complexity**: More integration points
- **Code Duplication**: Similar functionality built twice
- **Inconsistency Risk**: Divergent UX patterns
- **Resource Overhead**: More management and infrastructure
