## ADR-001: Multi-Team Micro-App Development Strategy

**Date**: 06-Jul-2025 (Sunday, 00:50 IST)  
**Status**: PENDING - On hold for strategic review  
**Deciders**: TBD - Requires stakeholder consultation  
**Technical Story**: Multi-team architecture for TalentExcel micro-apps

### Context

SaSarjan is scaling from 3 flagship apps to potentially 20+ domain apps, each with multiple micro-apps. The immediate decision point is how to structure development teams for TalentExcel's Internship and Fellowship micro-apps, which are similar in functionality but have different UX requirements.

**Current Situation:**

- 2 separate development teams available
- Internship and Fellowship micro-apps are quite similar (mainly UX differences)
- Vision for 20+ large apps with individual domains
- Each app will have micro-apps (sub-domains or /app-name paths)
- Potential for 100+ micro-apps across the platform

**Key Questions:**

1. Should same team develop both micro-apps or use separate teams?
2. How should teams access each other's code repositories?
3. What TalentExcel context should be shared with development teams?
4. How will this approach scale to 20+ apps?

### Decision

**Status**: DECISION PENDING

**Options Under Consideration:**

1. **Single Team Approach**: One team develops both Internship and Fellowship micro-apps
   - Pros: Consistency, efficiency, easier coordination
   - Cons: Slower delivery, potential bottlenecks

2. **Separate Teams Approach**: Dedicated teams for each micro-app
   - Pros: Parallel development, specialization, scalability
   - Cons: Coordination complexity, potential duplication

3. **Hybrid Model**: Shared foundation with specialized teams
   - Pros: Balance of efficiency and specialization
   - Cons: Initial complexity in setup

### Repository Architecture Options

**Option A: Monorepo**

- All apps and micro-apps in single repository
- Shared tooling and easy dependency management
- Risk of tight coupling

**Option B: Multi-Repo**

- Separate repositories for each micro-app
- Clear boundaries and team ownership
- Potential for code duplication

**Option C: Hybrid**

- Domain-level repositories with micro-app separation
- Balance of sharing and isolation

### Access Control Considerations

**Team Access Scenarios:**

1. **Full Transparency**: All teams can read all repositories
2. **Controlled Access**: Teams only access their own repositories
3. **Collaborative Model**: Teams can review each other's code

### Consequences

**If Single Team Approach:**

- ✅ Faster initial setup and consistency
- ✅ Unified user experience across micro-apps
- ❌ Slower delivery of multiple micro-apps
- ❌ Limited specialization and potential bottlenecks

**If Separate Teams Approach:**

- ✅ Faster parallel development
- ✅ Better scalability for 20+ app vision
- ✅ Teams become domain experts
- ❌ Higher coordination overhead
- ❌ Risk of inconsistent user experiences

**If Hybrid Model:**

- ✅ Balance of speed and consistency
- ✅ Good preparation for scaling
- ❌ More complex initial setup
- ❌ Requires strong architectural governance

### Follow-up Actions

**Before Making Decision:**

1. **Team Assessment**: Evaluate current developer capacity and skills
2. **Technical Analysis**: Deep dive into Internship vs. Fellowship similarities
3. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Product, design, and leadership input
4. **Prototype**: Optional proof-of-concept for chosen approach

**Decision Process:**

1. Schedule strategic planning session with key stakeholders
2. Conduct detailed technical assessment of micro-app requirements
3. Evaluate team preferences and career development goals
4. Document final decision with implementation timeline

**Success Metrics to Define:**

- Development velocity (features delivered per week)
- Code quality (test coverage, review cycle time)
- User experience consistency (design system compliance)
- Team satisfaction (developer happiness surveys)
- Scalability effectiveness (ease of adding new teams/micro-apps)

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Document all approaches as templates for future use
- Plan for reversibility if initial choice doesn't work
- Establish clear success criteria for 3-month review
