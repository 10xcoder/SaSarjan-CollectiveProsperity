## 🚀 IMPORTANT: 3-Team Structure & Repository Strategy (05-Jul-2025)

We are implementing a 3-team structure with clear separation of responsibilities and repository isolation for better scalability and security.

### Team Structure

#### 🤖 Claude AI Team

- **Role**: Automated development assistant
- **Capabilities**: Code generation, testing, documentation, routine tasks
- **Limitations**: No architecture decisions, credentials, or deployments
- **Work Hours**: 24/7 availability

#### 👥 Central Team (Human)

- **Role**: Core platform development & governance
- **Size**: 4-6 senior developers
- **Responsibilities**: Architecture, security, code review, deployments
- **Access**: Full monorepo access, production deployments

#### 🌍 Independent Developer Team

- **Role**: Feature module development
- **Size**: 10-30+ developers
- **Responsibilities**: Community modules, app features, integrations
- **Access**: Public module repos only

### Repository Isolation Strategy

```
