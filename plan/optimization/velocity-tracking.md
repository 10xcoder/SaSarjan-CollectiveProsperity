# Development Velocity Dashboard

**Purpose**: Track and optimize development speed in real-time  
**Impact**: Identify bottlenecks immediately, optimize continuously

## 📊 Key Velocity Metrics

### Daily Tracking

```json
{
  "date": "07-Jul-2025",
  "tasksCompleted": 5,
  "tasksBlocked": 11,
  "velocityScore": 2.3,
  "blockerTypes": {
    "decisions": 8,
    "technical": 2,
    "dependencies": 1
  }
}
```

### Weekly Trends

- **Velocity Score**: Tasks completed / (Tasks completed + blocked)
- **Blocker Ratio**: Blocked tasks / Total tasks
- **Decision Lag**: Average time from decision needed to received
- **Technical Debt**: Time spent on rework vs new features

## 🎯 Optimization Alerts

### Red Flags (Immediate Action)

- ⛔ Velocity score < 0.3 (more blocked than completed)
- ⛔ Decision lag > 24 hours
- ⛔ >50% time on rework

### Yellow Warnings

- ⚠️ Velocity score < 0.7
- ⚠️ >3 decisions pending simultaneously
- ⚠️ Same blockers appearing repeatedly

## 🚀 Speed Boosters

### Proven Optimizations

1. **Parallel development tracks** (+200% velocity)
2. **Component library** (+150% UI development)
3. **Code generation** (+400% scaffolding)
4. **Mock-first development** (+100% unblocking)
5. **Decision parallelization** (+300% decision speed)

### Implementation Priority

1. Today: Set up parallel tracks
2. Tomorrow: Component library
3. Day 3: Code generation
4. Day 4: Mock systems
5. Day 5: Velocity measurement

## 📈 Target Velocity Goals

### Week 1 Target

- Velocity Score: 0.8 (complete 4/5 tasks)
- Blocker Ratio: <0.2 (1 blocker per 5 tasks)
- Decision Response: <4 hours average

### Month 1 Target

- Velocity Score: 0.9 (complete 9/10 tasks)
- Zero decision blockers (all anticipated)
- 5x faster feature delivery

This dashboard helps maintain momentum and identify optimization opportunities immediately.
