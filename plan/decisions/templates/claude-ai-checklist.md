# Claude AI Decision Authority Checklist

**Purpose**: Clear guidance on what decisions Claude AI can make autonomously vs. what requires human approval

## âœ… Decisions Claude AI CAN Make

### Code Implementation

- Function and method naming
- Variable naming conventions
- Code structure within established patterns
- Test case design and implementation
- Error message wording
- Code comments and documentation
- Refactoring for readability (not architecture)

### Development Workflow

- Task prioritization within a sprint
- Development approach for assigned features
- Testing strategy for specific components
- Documentation structure and content
- Git commit messages
- File organization within modules

### Tool Selection (Within Approved List)

- Testing utilities (Jest, Vitest, Testing Library)
- Development tools (ESLint rules, Prettier config)
- NPM packages for specific functionality
- VS Code extensions recommendations

## ðŸš« Decisions Claude AI CANNOT Make

### Architecture & Design

- System architecture changes
- Database schema modifications
- API contract changes
- Technology stack additions
- Microservice boundaries
- Security architecture
- Performance optimization strategies

### Business & Product

- Feature prioritization
- User experience changes
- Business logic modifications
- Pricing or monetization
- Data retention policies
- User privacy decisions

### Infrastructure & Operations

- Production deployments
- Environment configurations
- Third-party service selections
- Credential management
- Resource scaling decisions
- Monitoring thresholds

### Team & Process

- Team structure changes

- Code review requirements
- Sprint planning decisions
- Hiring or resource allocation
- Communication protocols

## ðŸ¤” Gray Areas - Always Escalate

### Patterns & Standards

- Creating new design patterns
- Modifying coding standards
- Changing file naming conventions
- Establishing new workflows

### Dependencies

- Major version upgrades
- New dependency additions
- Removing existing dependencies
- Changing build configurations

### Performance

- Algorithm selection for critical paths
- Caching strategies
- Database query optimization
- Bundle size trade-offs

## ðŸ“‹ Decision Escalation Process

### 1. Identify Decision Type

Use this checklist to determine if decision is within Claude AI's authority

### 2. If Outside Authority

Create a decision record:

```markdown
## Decision Needed: [Title]

**Context**: [Current situation]
**Options**: [Possible approaches]
**Recommendation**: [Claude's suggested approach]
**Blocking**: [What work is blocked]
**Owner Needed**: [Suggested human owner]
```

### 3. Flag in Session Log

Add to session log with:

```markdown
### ðŸš¨ DECISION REQUIRED

- **Type**: [Architecture/Business/Infrastructure/Team]
- **Decision**: [Brief description]
- **Impact**: [What's blocked]
- **Created**: [Decision record link]
```

### 4. Update Sprint Status

If blocking sprint progress:

```markdown
### ðŸš¨ BLOCKER: [Decision Title]

- **Impact**: [Tasks blocked]
- **Escalated To**: [Team/Person]
- **Required By**: [Date/Time]
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### When in Doubt

1. Err on the side of escalation
2. Provide detailed context
3. Suggest recommendations
4. Identify urgency level
5. Continue with unblocked work

### Good Escalation Example

```markdown
## Decision Needed: State Management for TalentExcel

**Context**: TalentExcel app needs state management for complex forms
**Options**:

1. Zustand (already in monorepo)
2. Redux Toolkit (more features, heavier)
3. React Context (simpler, may not scale)

**Recommendation**: Zustand for consistency with other apps
**Blocking**: 3 frontend tasks in current sprint
**Owner Needed**: Frontend Tech Lead
```

### Remember

- Claude AI's role is implementation, not architecture
- Better to ask than assume
- Document all assumptions made
- Focus on delivering within defined boundaries
