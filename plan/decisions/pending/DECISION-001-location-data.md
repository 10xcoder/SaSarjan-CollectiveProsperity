# Decision: Location Data Strategy

**ID**: DECISION-001  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING  
**Type**: Technical/Operational  
**Owner**: CEO  
**Created**: 07-Jul-2025, Monday 08:25 IST  
**Deadline**: 07-Jul-2025, Monday 12:00 PM IST  
**Impact**: High - Affects database size, import time, and user experience

## Context

We need hierarchical location data for India to support location-based features across all apps. This includes personalization, geo-filtering, and location-aware content.

## Problem Statement

Should we import all 600,000+ Indian villages upfront or start with major population centers and grow organically?

## Options Analysis

### Option A: Complete Village Import

**Approach**: Import all 600,000+ villages from Census 2011 data

**Pros**:

- Complete coverage from day one
- No missing locations for rural users
- Better for government/NGO partnerships
- One-time import effort

**Cons**:

- 2GB+ database size increase
- Longer initial import time (2-3 hours)
- More complex search/autocomplete
- Higher infrastructure costs initially

**Technical Requirements**:

- PostGIS optimizations for large datasets
- Elasticsearch indexing for all locations
- CDN for location API responses

### Option B: Phased Approach (Recommended by Claude)

**Approach**: Import cities/towns with 50,000+ population, add villages dynamically

**Pros**:

- Lean start (200MB data)
- Faster initial deployment
- User-driven growth
- Lower initial costs

**Cons**:

- Rural users might not find their village initially
- Need crowdsourcing mechanism
- Ongoing data quality management
- May need manual verification

**Technical Requirements**:

- User submission system for new locations
- Verification workflow
- Progressive data loading

## Implementation Impact

### Database Schema

Both options use same schema, different data volume:

```sql
locations (
  id, name, local_name, type, parent_id,
  level, lgd_code, postal_codes,
  coordinates, bounds, metadata,
  is_verified, created_at, updated_at
)
```

### Search Performance

- Option A: Need robust caching and indexing
- Option B: Simpler initial performance tuning

### User Experience

- Option A: All locations available immediately
- Option B: Major locations available, others added on request

## Recommendation

Claude recommends Option B for faster time-to-market and iterative improvement.
