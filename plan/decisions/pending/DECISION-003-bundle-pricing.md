# Decision: Bundle Pricing Model

**ID**: DECISION-003  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING  
**Type**: Business/Strategic  
**Owner**: CEO  
**Created**: 07-Jul-2025, Monday 08:25 IST  
**Deadline**: 11-Jul-2025, Thursday  
**Impact**: High - Affects revenue model and database schema

## Context

Apps can be sold individually or bundled together (e.g., TalentExcel = Internship + Fellowship apps). We need a pricing strategy that incentivizes bundles while maintaining flexibility.

## Problem Statement

How should we structure bundle pricing, discounts, and location-based data access pricing?

## Pricing Components to Decide

### 1. Bundle Discount Structure

How much discount for buying multiple apps together?

**Option A: Fixed Percentage**

- 2 apps: 15% off
- 3 apps: 25% off
- 4+ apps: 35% off

**Option B: Dynamic Pricing**

- Discount based on app categories
- Higher discount for complementary apps
- Seasonal promotional bundles

**Option C: Subscription Model**

- Monthly: â‚¹X per app
- Bundle: â‚¹Y for all apps
- Annual: Additional 20% off

### 2. Location-Based Data Pricing

Users can buy data access for specific geographic regions.

**Option A: Tiered Geographic Pricing**

```
- Village/Block: â‚¹100/month
- District: â‚¹500/month
- State: â‚¹2,000/month
- National: â‚¹5,000/month
- Global: â‚¹10,000/month
```

**Option B: Population-Based Pricing**

```
- <100K population: â‚¹200/month
- 100K-1M population: â‚¹1,000/month
- 1M-10M population: â‚¹3,000/month
- 10M+ population: â‚¹5,000/month
```

**Option C: Feature-Based Access**

```
- View-only: Free
- Contact access: â‚¹X
- Analytics access: â‚¹Y
- Export capability: â‚¹Z
```

### 3. Developer Revenue Share

How much do developers earn from bundle sales?

**Option A: Proportional Share**

- Developer gets same % regardless of bundle
- Example: 70% always goes to developer

**Option B: Incentivized Bundle Participation**

- Individual app: 70% to developer
- In bundle: 80% to developer (SaSarjan takes less)

**Option C: Tiered Revenue Share**

- <â‚¹10K revenue: 80% to developer
- â‚¹10K-1L: 70% to developer
- â‚¹1L+: 60% to developer

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: TalentExcel Bundle

- Internship App: â‚¹299/month individual
- Fellowship App: â‚¹399/month individual
- Bundle Price: â‚¹599/month (15% discount)
- Data Access (State): +â‚¹2,000/month

### Scenario 2: Complete Prosperity Bundle

- All 20 apps: â‚¹2,999/month
- Individual total would be: â‚¹4,999/month
- Savings: 40%

### Scenario 3: NGO Special Pricing

- Verified NGOs: 50% off all prices
- Government: Custom enterprise pricing
- Educational institutions: 30% off

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Requirements

```sql
-- Bundle definition
bundles (
  id, name, slug, description,
  base_price, discount_percent,
  valid_from, valid_until
)

-- Bundle pricing rules
bundle_pricing_rules (
  id, bundle_id, rule_type,
  condition_json, discount_amount,
  priority
)

-- Location data pricing
location_data_pricing (
  id, geographic_level,
  population_range_min, population_range_max,
  monthly_price, annual_price
)
```

## Market Research

- Competing platforms charge â‚¹500-2000/month
- Indian users prefer bundles with 20-30% discounts
- B2B customers want location-based pricing

## Recommendation

Claude suggests Option A for simplicity in MVP phase, with ability to evolve to Option B/C based on user feedback.
