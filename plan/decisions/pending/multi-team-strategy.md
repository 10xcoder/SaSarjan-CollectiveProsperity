# PENDING DECISION: Multi-Team Micro-App Development Strategy

**Status**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Blocking Week 1 Development  
**Date Raised**: 06-Jul-2025  
**Decision Deadline**: 07-Jul-2025 (TODAY)  
**Owner**: TBD - Requires stakeholder assignment  
**Related ADR**: [ADR-001](/docs/architecture/decision-log.md#adr-001-multi-team-micro-app-development-strategy)

## Executive Summary

Need immediate decision on whether to use single team or multiple teams for TalentExcel's Internship and Fellowship micro-apps. This decision will set precedent for scaling to 20+ apps with 100+ micro-apps.

## Current Situation

- 2 development teams available and ready to start
- TalentExcel has 2 similar micro-apps (Internship & Fellowship)
- Mainly UX differences between the micro-apps
- Week 1 development blocked without clear direction

## Options Under Consideration

### Option 1: Single Team Approach

One team develops both micro-apps sequentially or with shared codebase

**Pros**:

- Maximum code reuse and consistency
- Easier coordination and communication
- Single point of accountability
- Faster initial setup

**Cons**:

- Slower overall delivery (sequential work)
- Team becomes bottleneck
- Less specialization opportunity
- Doesn't test multi-team collaboration model

### Option 2: Separate Teams Approach

Dedicated teams for each micro-app working in parallel

**Pros**:

- Parallel development = faster delivery
- Tests multi-team coordination early
- Teams can specialize in their domains
- Scales better to 20+ apps vision

**Cons**:

- Risk of code duplication
- Need coordination mechanisms
- Potential inconsistencies
- Higher communication overhead

### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Recommended)

Shared foundation team + specialized feature teams

**Approach**:

- Week 1: Single team builds shared foundation
- Week 2: Split into specialized teams
- Continuous: Shared component library

**Pros**:

- Balances consistency and speed
- Gradual scaling approach
- Reduces duplication risk
- Maintains quality standards

**Cons**:

- Requires careful planning
- Initial week might feel slow
- Need clear handoff process

## Impact Analysis

### Immediate Impact (Week 1)

- 2 teams waiting for direction
- 10+ developers affected
- Sprint goals at risk

### Long-term Impact (6 months)

- Sets pattern for 20+ apps
- Defines collaboration model
- Impacts hiring needs
- Affects architecture decisions

## Stakeholder Positions

- **Development Teams**: Prefer clarity and autonomy
- **Product Team**: Wants fast delivery
- **Architecture Team**: Emphasizes consistency
- **Business**: Cost and timeline focused

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Model (Option 3)** provides best balance:

1. Week 1: Build shared foundation together
2. Week 2: Split teams with clear interfaces
3. Ongoing: Regular sync and component sharing

## Required Actions

1. **Today (07-Jul)**:
   - [ ] Emergency stakeholder meeting (2 PM IST)
   - [ ] Document final decision
   - [ ] Communicate to teams
   - [ ] Update sprint plans

2. **Today (07-Jul)**:
   - [ ] Kick off Week 1 development
   - [ ] Set up team structures
   - [ ] Define success metrics

## Success Criteria

- Both micro-apps delivered within 4 weeks
- Code reuse > 70%
- No blocking dependencies between teams
- Clear model for future apps

## Escalation

If no decision by 2 PM IST today:

1. Escalate to CTO
2. Default to Option 3 (Hybrid)
3. Document assumptions
4. Review after Week 1
