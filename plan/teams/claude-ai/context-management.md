## üéØ Context Management Objectives

### Why Context Matters

1. **Efficiency** - Avoid re-learning project details in each session
2. **Consistency** - Maintain coding patterns and architectural decisions
3. **Progress** - Build incrementally on previous work
4. **Quality** - Retain understanding of complex business logic
5. **Team Alignment** - Stay synchronized with human team decisions

### Success Metrics

- **Session Startup Time** - <5 minutes to understand current state
- **Context Accuracy** - >95% correct understanding of project state
- **Progress Continuity** - Build effectively on previous session work
- **Decision Consistency** - Follow established patterns and decisions

## üìö Context Information Categories

```

## üîÑ Context Preservation Strategies

### 1. Session Log Method

**Most Important**: Comprehensive session logging

```markdown
**Context Preservation in Session Logs**:

- Detailed state information at session end
- Next session preparation notes
- Decisions made and reasoning
- Code patterns established
- Files created or modified
```

**Template for Context Preservation**:

```markdown
## Context for Next Session

### Project State

- **Current Branch**: [git branch name]
- **Active Feature**: [feature being developed]
- **Development Status**: [what's running/configured]
- **Recent Changes**: [summary of recent work]

### Key Decisions Made

- [DECISION]: [reasoning and implications]
- [PATTERN]: [new pattern established]

### Next Priorities

1. [TASK]: [why this is next priority]
2. [TASK]: [context and dependencies]

### Required Reading

- [FILE]: [why this file is important]
- [DOCUMENT]: [key information to retain]
```

### 2. State Snapshot Method

**Quick Reference**: Create concise state snapshots

```markdown
# Current State Snapshot - DD-MMM-YYYY, Day HH:MM IST

## Active Work

- **Sprint**: Week X - [Sprint Name]
- **Feature**: [Current feature development]
- **Files**: [Key files being worked on]
- **Status**: [current progress state]

## Recent Progress

- **Completed**: [what was finished recently]
- **In Progress**: [what's partially done]
- **Next**: [immediate next steps]

## Context Notes

- **Architecture**: [any architectural decisions]
- **Patterns**: [coding patterns being used]
- **Dependencies**: [what we're waiting for]
```

### 3. Decision Record Method

**Long-term Memory**: Maintain decision history

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Decision: [Brief title]

**Date**: DD-MMM-YYYY  
**Status**: [Proposed/Accepted/Superseded]

### Context

[Why this decision was needed]

### Decision

[What was decided]

### Reasoning

[Why this approach was chosen]

### Consequences

[Positive and negative implications]

### Implementation Notes

[How this affects ongoing development]
```

## üìñ Context Reading Strategies

### Session Start Checklist

```markdown
## Context Restoration Process (5 minutes)

1. **Read Latest Session Log** (2 minutes)
   - Focus on "Next Session Preparation" section
   - Note any blockers or dependencies
   - Understand current sprint alignment

2. **Check Current State** (1 minute)
   - Git status and branch
   - Development server status
   - Recent commits since last session

3. **Review Active Issues** (1 minute)
   - Check GitHub issues assigned
   - Read any new comments or updates
   - Identify priority tasks

4. **Update Context Understanding** (1 minute)
   - Confirm sprint status in strategic/sprints.md
   - Check for any team updates
   - Verify environment state
```

### Deep Context Review (When Needed)

```markdown
## Comprehensive Context Review (15-20 minutes)

**When to Use**:

- After long gaps between sessions
- When starting new major features
- When context seems unclear or inconsistent
- When previous session indicates major changes

**Process**:

1. Read last 3 session logs for trend understanding
2. Review current sprint goals and status
3. Check recent commits and PR activity
4. Read any updated documentation
5. Understand current team priorities
6. Verify development environment setup
```

## üß† Memory Techniques

### 1. Progressive Context Building

```markdown
**Layered Understanding**:

- Level 1: Basic project structure and tech stack
- Level 2: Current sprint goals and active features
- Level 3: Detailed implementation patterns and decisions
- Level 4: Team dynamics and communication patterns
- Level 5: Business context and user journey understanding
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition

```markdown
**Code Patterns to Remember**:

- Component structure: How React components are organized
- API patterns: How routes are structured and authenticated
- Database patterns: How Supabase queries are written
- Styling patterns: How Tailwind CSS is used consistently
- Testing patterns: How tests are written and organized
```

### 3. Decision Mapping

```markdown
**Decision Categories to Track**:

- Architecture decisions (framework choices, structure)
- Code organization decisions (file structure, naming)
- Integration decisions (how services connect)
- UI/UX decisions (design patterns, user flows)
- Process decisions (workflow, review process)
```

## üîó Context Linking Strategies

### Cross-Reference System

```markdown
**Linking Related Information**:

- Session logs reference relevant documentation
- Code changes link to architectural decisions
- Feature work connects to user stories
- Bug fixes reference original implementation context
```

### Context Threads

```markdown
**Maintaining Context Threads**:

- Feature development thread: All work on specific feature
- Architecture thread: All structural and design decisions
- Process thread: All workflow and team coordination
- Quality thread: All testing and improvement work
```

## üìä Context Quality Metrics

### Effectiveness Indicators

- **Quick Start**: Can begin productive work within 5 minutes
- **Correct Decisions**: Make choices consistent with previous decisions
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established coding patterns
- **Team Alignment**: Work aligns with current team priorities

### Context Failure Symptoms

./scripts/recent-activity.sh    # Show recent commits and changes
./scripts/context-summary.sh    # Generate context summary
./scripts/session-prep.sh       # Prepare for new session
```

## üéØ Context Management Best Practices

### During Development

1. **Document Decisions** - Record why choices were made
2. **Update Context** - Keep session logs current throughout session
3. **Cross-Reference** - Link related work and decisions
4. **Pattern Notes** - Record new patterns as they emerge

### Between Sessions

1. **Complete Session Logs** - Ensure all context is captured
2. **State Preservation** - Document current development state
3. **Priority Setting** - Clear next steps for continuation
4. **Blocker Documentation** - Clear description of dependencies

### Session Transitions

1. **Context Handoff** - Detailed notes for next session
2. **State Verification** - Confirm current state is documented
3. **Priority Alignment** - Next work aligns with sprint goals
4. **Resource Links** - Point to relevant files and documentation

Remember: **Good context management is an investment in future productivity**. Time spent preserving context pays dividends in faster session startups and more consistent work quality.
