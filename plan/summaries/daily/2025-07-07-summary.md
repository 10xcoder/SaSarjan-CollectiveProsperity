# Daily Summary - 07-Jul-2025 (Monday)

**Date**: 07-Jul-2025, Monday  
**Sessions**: 2 (Morning planning, sprint setup)  
**Key Achievement**: Week 1 sprint planned with 3-team structure

## ðŸŽ¯ Important Prompts & Responses

### 1. Sprint Planning Request (08:12 IST)

**Prompt**:

```
i am ready to beging my new sprint from this monday to next sunday, i would like you to plan a sprint
where 3 teams will be in action, claude as a top class coder, 1 junior coder who will work on talentexcel,
and I will operate as the CEO to plan and make decisions...
```

**Key Points**:

- 3-team structure established
- Focus on sasarjan.com and talentexcel.com launches
- Hierarchical location system requirement
- App bundling with location filters
- Multi-location user profiles

**Response Summary**: Created comprehensive Week 1 plan with daily breakdowns and clear team assignments

### 2. Location Strategy Clarification (08:15 IST)

**Prompt**:

```
what about location data, i would like to use low cost open source map solutions, maybe we will find
a cloud provider so we do not have to host ourselves, do we need a pre-built location data of villages
of India or will it be dynamic
```

**Decision Points**:

- OpenStreetMap + Pelias recommended
- Hybrid approach: pre-built for cities, dynamic for villages
- Cost estimate: <$30/month for 100k+ users
- PostGIS for geographic queries

### 3. Decision Management System (08:16 IST)

**Prompt**:

```
where are decisions to be taken stored? when should i decide and how should i let you know all together
```

**Action Taken**: Created `/plan/decisions/` hub with:

- 3 pending decisions documented
- Clear deadlines and communication methods
- Decision templates for future use

### 4. Summary System Request (08:40 IST)

**Prompt**:

```
ok can you put a system to save summaries somewhere as it kind of gets lost when the sessions is over
```

**Result**: Created this summary system at `/plan/summaries/`
